# TaskMaster Wisdom Integration Summary

## üéØ Quick Action Items

### 1. Add Task 16: "Study Wisdom Documentation" ‚úÖ DONE

- Created as prerequisite for all other tasks
- Contains required reading list and time estimates

### 2. Tasks Requiring Wisdom Doc References

| Task ID | Task Title                        | Wisdom Doc Section Needed                            |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 3       | Implement DCS API client          | CRITICAL_LEARNINGS: "DCS Catalog API"                |
| 6       | Create USFM text extractor        | DISTILLED_WISDOM: "USFM Text Extraction"             |
| 8       | Implement resource aggregator     | COMPREHENSIVE_PATTERNS: "Multi-Resource Integration" |
| 13      | Ingredients-based file resolution | ALL THREE DOCS: "Ingredients Array" (MOST CRITICAL!) |
| 14      | Handle verse bridges              | DISTILLED_WISDOM: "Verse bridges regex"              |
| 15      | Resource-specific TSV parsers     | COMPREHENSIVE_PATTERNS: "TSV column structures"      |

### 3. Key Updates Needed Per Task

**Task 3** - Add to details:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Read wisdom docs FIRST! Pattern already solved in:
- docs/CRITICAL_TRANSLATION_HELPS_LEARNINGS_FOR_MCP.md
Use exact endpoints: /api/v1/catalog/list/owners, etc.
NO MANIFESTS - use metadataType=rc
```

**Task 13** - Add to details:

```
üö® THE #1 CRITICAL DISCOVERY üö®
Files have UNPREDICTABLE names! Read ALL wisdom docs.
NEVER hardcode paths. ALWAYS use ingredients array.
This took WEEKS to figure out - don't repeat!
```

### 4. Implementation Order

1. Everyone reads Task 16 (wisdom docs) FIRST
2. Update task details to reference specific wisdom sections
3. During implementation, keep wisdom docs open
4. Copy patterns EXACTLY - don't "improve" them

### 5. Expected Savings

- Task 3: Save 2-3 days (API patterns documented)
- Task 6: Save 1 week (USFM extraction solved)
- Task 13: Save 2+ WEEKS (ingredients discovery)
- Task 14: Save 3-4 days (verse bridge patterns)
- Overall: 4-6 weeks saved by using wisdom docs

## üö® Bottom Line

The wisdom docs contain solutions to EVERY technical challenge in these tasks. Not using them is like having a map but choosing to wander in the forest. Update the tasks to reference the wisdom docs, or watch history repeat itself.
