## ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. ‚úÖ **FIXED: API Documentation Page False Deprecation Claims**

- Updated to show REST API endpoints as fully functional and current
- Added accurate response examples
- Clarified that both REST API and MCP tools are available
- Enhanced documentation with proper examples and copy functionality

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED**

### 2. ‚úÖ **FIXED: Quick Start Instructions Were Incorrect**

**Location**: Main page (`ui/src/routes/+page.svelte`)

**Problem**: Quick Start step 1 claimed incorrect MCP server URL format `mcp://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/`

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **CORRECTED**

- Updated to show REST API usage as primary option
- Fixed MCP server instructions to show actual command: `npx tsx src/index.ts`
- Made it clear that there are two interfaces: REST API and MCP Server

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED**

## üö® REMAINING ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE

### 3. **Version Information Inconsistency**

**Location**: Various locations including health endpoint

**Problem**:

- Package.json shows version 3.4.0 ‚úÖ
- Health endpoint returns version "1.3.0" ‚ùå
- This suggests hardcoded version numbers in some places

**Investigation Needed**:

- [ ] Check where version "1.3.0" is hardcoded
- [ ] Ensure all version references are dynamic
- [ ] Update health endpoint to use package.json version

**Status**: ‚ùì **NEEDS TESTING**
