## Core Principles

1. **MCP-Only Data**: The system only provides data from MCP tools, no external knowledge
2. **Dynamic Discovery**: Tools are discovered at runtime, not hardcoded
3. **LLM-Driven Formatting**: Let the LLM format responses naturally
4. **Transparency**: X-ray debugging shows exactly what's happening
5. **Proper Citations**: Every piece of information is properly attributed
