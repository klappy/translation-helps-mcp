# Real Data Connection Progress

## Overview

We've successfully started connecting real data sources to our v2 endpoints, moving away from mock data to actual Bible translation resources from the DCS (Door43 Content Service) API.

## What's Working

### ✅ Scripture Fetching

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v2/fetch-scripture`
- **Status**: Connected to real data
- **Resources**: UST (unfoldingWord Simplified Text) confirmed working
- **Fallback**: Still uses mock data when real data fetch fails

### ✅ Translation Notes

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v2/translation-notes`
- **Status**: Connected to real data
- **Format**: Parses TSV files from DCS
- **Fallback**: Uses mock data when real data unavailable

### ✅ Translation Questions

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v2/translation-questions`
- **Status**: Connected to real data
- **Format**: Parses TSV Translation Questions from DCS
- **Features**: Chapter-based filtering, includes answers when available
- **Fallback**: Uses mock data when real data unavailable

### ✅ Translation Words

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v2/fetch-translation-words`
- **Status**: Connected to real data
- **Format**: Parses Markdown Translation Words from DCS
- **Features**: Dictionary definitions, related terms, Bible references
- **Note**: Some encoding issues with special characters
- **Fallback**: Uses mock data when real data unavailable

### ✅ Languages Discovery

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v2/simple-languages`
- **Status**: Connected to real data
- **Format**: Extracts languages from DCS catalog
- **Features**: Language metadata, resource filtering, coverage stats
- **Real Count**: 45+ languages available
- **Fallback**: Uses mock data when real data unavailable

### ✅ Books Discovery

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v2/get-available-books`
- **Status**: Connected to real data
- **Format**: Extracts available books from DCS catalog
- **Features**: Book metadata, testament filtering, chapter counts
- **Fallback**: Uses multiple fallback strategies (repo contents, then mock)

### Implementation Details

1. **edgeScriptureFetcher.ts** - Scripture fetcher that:
   - Connects directly to the DCS API
   - Searches the catalog for available resources
   - Fetches USFM files and extracts requested verses
   - Works within edge runtime constraints

2. **edgeTranslationNotesFetcher.ts** - Translation notes fetcher that:
   - Searches for TSV Translation Notes resources
   - Parses TSV format into structured data
   - Filters notes by reference
   - Categorizes notes by type (general, translation, key-term)

3. **edgeTranslationQuestionsFetcher.ts** - Translation questions fetcher that:
   - Searches for TSV Translation Questions resources
   - Parses TSV format with question/answer pairs
   - Filters questions by chapter reference
   - Returns structured data with optional answers

4. **edgeTranslationWordsFetcher.ts** - Translation words fetcher that:
   - Searches for Translation Words resources
   - Fetches markdown files for word definitions
   - Parses markdown to extract definitions, related terms, references
   - Currently uses a simplified approach (will need proper indexing)

5. **edgeLanguagesFetcher.ts** - Languages discovery fetcher that:
   - Searches the entire Bible catalog
   - Extracts unique languages from all resources
   - Calculates coverage statistics per language
   - Supports resource-based filtering

6. **edgeBooksFetcher.ts** - Books discovery fetcher that:
   - Searches for resources by language and type
   - Extracts available books from ingredients
   - Maintains canonical book order
   - Supports testament and resource filtering

## Architecture

```
User Request → v2 Endpoint → Edge Scripture Fetcher → DCS API
                    ↓
                Fallback to Mock Data (if needed)
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Smart Resource Discovery**: Instead of hardcoding repo names, we search the catalog dynamically
2. **Ingredient-Based File Paths**: Uses DCS ingredients to find correct file paths
3. **Edge Compatible**: No Node.js dependencies, works in Cloudflare Workers
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to mock data when real data isn't available

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. **Expand Scripture Resources**: Add support for ULT, T4T, UEB, and other translations
2. **Translation Helps**: Connect translation notes, questions, and words endpoints
3. **Remove Mock Data**: Once all resources are connected, remove mock data completely

### Medium Priority

1. **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper caching for DCS responses
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and retry logic
3. **Performance**: Optimize USFM parsing and data extraction

### Low Priority

1. **Additional Languages**: Expand beyond English
2. **Version Management**: Handle different resource versions
3. **Offline Support**: Cache resources for offline use

## Technical Decisions

### Why Edge-Compatible?

- Runs on Cloudflare Workers (our deployment target)
- Better performance with global distribution
- No cold starts
- Simplified architecture

### Why Direct DCS Connection?

- Simpler than using ZipResourceFetcher2
- More transparent data flow
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Better suited for edge runtime

### Why Keep Mock Data (For Now)?

- Ensures endpoints remain functional during transition
- Allows incremental migration
- Provides fallback for missing resources
- Enables testing without external dependencies

## Testing

Test real data connection:

```bash
# Test UST (working)
curl "http://localhost:8174/api/v2/fetch-scripture?reference=John%203:16&resource=ust"

# Test multiple resources
curl "http://localhost:8174/api/v2/fetch-scripture?reference=John%203:16&resource=ust,ult"
```

## Challenges Overcome

1. **DCS API Structure**: Understanding the catalog search and ingredient system
2. **Edge Runtime Limits**: Working without Node.js modules
3. **USFM Parsing**: Extracting verses from USFM format
4. **Resource Discovery**: Finding resources by abbreviation rather than exact repo names

## Success Metrics

- ✅ First real scripture fetched successfully
- ✅ Fallback mechanism working properly
- ✅ Edge-compatible implementation
- ⏳ All scripture resources connected (in progress)
- ⏳ All endpoints using real data (in progress)

## Conclusion

We've successfully proven that real data connection is possible and working. The architecture is clean, simple, and maintainable. With this foundation, connecting the remaining endpoints will be straightforward.
