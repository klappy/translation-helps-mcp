## 📚 Testing Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests with comprehensive reporting
npm test

# Quick smoke test (30 seconds)
npm run test:smoke

# Full parity validation (5-10 minutes)
npm run test:parity

# Regression testing (2-3 minutes)
npm run test:regression
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ **9 API Endpoints** fully tested
- ✅ **9 MCP Wrappers** with parity validation
- ✅ **Error Scenarios** comprehensively covered
- ✅ **Performance Benchmarks** established
- ✅ **Regression Cases** from previous bugs

---

## 🎯 Impact

**Before This Release:**

- ❌ Frequent regressions during development
- ❌ No automated validation of endpoint parity
- ❌ Manual testing required for each change
- ❌ Risk of reintroducing previously fixed bugs

**After This Release:**

- ✅ Comprehensive automated test coverage
- ✅ Guaranteed API/MCP endpoint parity
- ✅ Regression prevention through targeted tests
- ✅ Fast feedback loop for developers
- ✅ CI/CD ready test infrastructure
