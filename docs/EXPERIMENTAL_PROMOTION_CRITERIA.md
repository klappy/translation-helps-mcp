  - Risk assessment

### 2. Partner Approval ✅

- **Required**: Sign-off from at least one partner organization
- **Evidence**:

  - Feedback documented
  - Use cases validated
  - No blocking issues reported

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Requirements

| Percentile    | Maximum Time |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| 50th (median) | < 200ms      |
| 95th          | < 500ms      |
| 99th          | < 1000ms     |

### Cache Performance

- **Hit Ratio**: > 80% after warm-up period

### Load Tests

```yaml
load_test_requirements:
  sustained_load:
    duration: 1_hour
    requests_per_second: 100
    error_threshold: 0.1%
  spike_test:
    peak_rps: 1000
    duration: 5_minutes
    recovery_time: < 30_seconds
  endurance_test:
    duration: 24_hours
    requests_per_second: 50
    memory_leak_check: true
```

## Promotion Process

### 1. Preparation Phase

1. Create promotion request issue
2. Gather all required evidence
3. Run final test suite
4. Update documentation

### 2. Review Phase

1. Maintainer technical review
2. Partner functional review
3. Security review (if applicable)
4. Performance review

### 3. Migration Phase

```bash
# Migration checklist
- [ ] Remove -experimental suffix from files
- [ ] Move to appropriate core directory
- [ ] Update all imports
- [ ] Remove experimental warnings
- [ ] Add to core endpoint registry
- [ ] Update public documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide
```

### 4. Announcement Phase

1. Update CHANGELOG.md
2. Create release notes
3. Notify partners
4. Update MCP tools interface

## Example Promotion Request

```markdown
# Promotion Request: AI Content Summarizer

## Summary

Request to promote AI Content Summarizer from experimental to core.

### Approvals

- [x] Maintainer approval: @username (link)
- [x] Partner approval: Organization X (link)

### Performance Metrics

- 50th percentile: 180ms ✅
- 95th percentile: 420ms ✅
- Cache hit ratio: 85% ✅
- Error rate: 0.05% ✅

### Testing

- Testing period: 2025-02-01 to 2025-03-01
- Total requests: 125,000
- Unique users: 12
- Critical issues: 0

### Documentation

- [x] API docs: /docs/api/ai-summarizer.md
- [x] Integration guide: /docs/guides/ai-integration.md
- [x] Migration guide: /docs/migration/ai-summarizer.md

### Test Coverage

- Unit tests: 94% coverage
- Integration tests: 15 scenarios
- Load test results: [link to results]

## Risk Assessment

Low risk - feature is additive and doesn't modify existing functionality.

## Migration Plan

1. Move files on 2025-03-15
2. Update imports
3. Deploy to staging
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. Deploy to production
```

## Rejection Reasons

Features may be rejected for promotion if:

1. **Performance**: Fails to meet benchmarks
2. **Stability**: High error rates or crashes
3. **Documentation**: Incomplete or unclear
4. **Testing**: Insufficient coverage or testing period
5. **Design**: Fundamental design issues identified
6. **Maintenance**: High maintenance burden anticipated
7. **Security**: Security vulnerabilities discovered
8. **Compatibility**: Breaking changes to existing APIs

## Post-Promotion Monitoring

After promotion, monitor for 30 days:

- [ ] Error rates remain low
- [ ] Performance remains stable
- [ ] No unexpected issues reported
- [ ] Usage patterns as expected

If issues arise, feature may be rolled back to experimental status.

**Remember**: The goal is to ensure only battle-tested, well-documented, and performant features make it to core. When in doubt, keep it experimental longer!
