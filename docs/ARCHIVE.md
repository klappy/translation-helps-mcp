## 🚫 Netlify Migration (DEPRECATED - Now Cloudflare Only)

**Summary**: Project migrated from Netlify to Cloudflare Workers for better performance and cost efficiency.

**Key Points**:

- Netlify Functions → Cloudflare Workers
- Netlify Blobs → Cloudflare KV
- Cost reduction: ~$50/month → ~$5/month
- Performance improvement: 2-3x faster response times
- All Netlify code removed in v4.3.0

**Reference**: Original deployment worked but Cloudflare provides superior scaling and economics.

## 📋 Lessons Learned Files (CONSOLIDATED → COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)

**Summary**: Three overlapping wisdom documents consolidated into single definitive guide.

**What Was Consolidated**:

- `TRANSLATION_HELPS_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (253 lines) → Testing insights, deployment specifics
- `CRITICAL_TRANSLATION_HELPS_LEARNINGS_FOR_MCP.md` (252 lines) → Performance targets, API quirks
- `TRANSLATION_HELPS_DISTILLED_WISDOM.md` (777 lines) → Complete patterns (used as base)

**Result**: Single `TRANSLATION_HELPS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` file with 90% duplicate content removed while preserving all unique insights.

**Key Consolidated Wisdom**:

- Ingredients array is sacred (never hardcode file paths)
- Performance targets: <1s languages, <2s resources
- API quirks: 422 errors, case sensitivity, graceful fallbacks
- Testing patterns: Mock catalog, test error paths
- Deployment considerations: Cold starts, memory persistence

## ✅ MCP Migration (COMPLETED)

**Summary**: Successfully migrated from standalone API to Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture.

**Key Migration Points**:

- Added MCP server wrapper around existing functions
- Maintained API endpoint compatibility
- Enhanced with structured tool definitions
- Both REST API and MCP tools work simultaneously
- No breaking changes to existing integrations

**Architecture**: MCP tools call the same core functions as REST endpoints, ensuring perfect parity.
