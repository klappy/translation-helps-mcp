# Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation that has been archived for historical reference or because it describes features/approaches that are no longer current.

## Structure

- **old-prds/** - Product Requirements Documents from before the 2025 refactor
- **deprecated-guides/** - Guides for features that have been removed or significantly changed
- **experimental-features/** - Documentation for experimental features that didn't make it to production
- **cache-warming/** - Documentation related to the removed cache warming functionality

## Why Archive?

Documents are archived rather than deleted to:

1. Preserve historical context
2. Understand past design decisions
3. Reference old approaches if needed
4. Maintain a record of what was tried and why it was changed

## Archived Items

Each subdirectory contains a log of what was archived and when. Items are archived when:

- They reference outdated implementations
- They describe removed features
- They contain time-travel dates (references to dates before project start)
- They document experimental features that were never promoted to core
