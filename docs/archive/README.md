# Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation that is no longer actively maintained or relevant to the current implementation.

## Archive Structure

- **old-prds/** - Product Requirement Documents from before the project inception (January 2025)
- **deprecated-guides/** - Guides for features that have been removed or superseded
- **experimental-features/** - Documentation for experimental features that didn't make it to production
- **cache-warming/** - Old cache warming documentation (feature was removed)

## Why Archive?

Documents are moved here when they:

- Reference dates before the project started (anything before January 2025)
- Describe features that have been removed
- Contain outdated information that could confuse new developers
- Were placeholder or aspirational documentation that was never implemented

## Note

These documents are kept for historical reference only. For current documentation, see the main `/docs` directory.
