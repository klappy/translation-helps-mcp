# Performance Report - Summary

**Original Date Claims:** July 20, 2025 (Note: AI-generated future date, not real)  
**Actual Date:** Unknown (within 2 weeks of project start)  
**Archived:** Current date

## What This Was

A performance report claiming "revolutionary" improvements to the Translation Helps MCP API through response-level caching.

## Claims Made

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - 100% success rate (up from 99.7%)
   - Cache hit response times: 176-199ms
   - 70%+ performance improvement
   - A+ performance grade

2. **Endpoint Performance:**
   - All endpoints showing 25-30% improvement with caching
   - Handling 100+ concurrent requests
   - 6+ requests per second throughput

## Why Archived

This report is dated July 20, 2025 (the future) and makes aspirational claims about "revolutionary" performance improvements. The specific metrics and perfect success rates suggest this was a target specification rather than actual measured performance.

## Recommendation

If performance testing is needed, conduct actual load tests on the current system rather than relying on this speculative report.
