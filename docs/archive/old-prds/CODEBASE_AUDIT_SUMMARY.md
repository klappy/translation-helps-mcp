# Codebase Audit - Summary

**Original Date Claims:** July 22, 2025 (Note: AI-generated future date, not real)  
**Actual Date:** Unknown (within 2 weeks of project start)  
**Archived:** Current date

## What This Was

An audit of orphaned code, Netlify remnants, and optimization opportunities in the codebase.

## Key Findings Preserved

1. **Orphaned Files:**
   - `src/functions/handlers/get-languages-old.ts` - deprecated handler with hardcoded version
   - Recommendation was to delete it

2. **Netlify Remnants:**
   - `src/functions/caches/netlify-cache.ts` - platform-specific cache for Netlify Blobs
   - Various build artifacts and development files
   - Migration scripts that may no longer be needed

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - Hardcoded versions instead of using getVersion()
   - Old caching logic in deprecated handlers
   - Incomplete migration scripts

## Why Archived

This audit claims to be from July 2025 (the future) and references a "migration to Cloudflare" that may or may not have happened. The speculative nature and impossible date indicate this was aspirational documentation rather than an actual audit.

## Recommendation

If cleanup is needed, perform a fresh audit based on the actual current state of the codebase rather than relying on this speculative document.

## Original File

The full 282-line audit has been archived. Technical details about specific files have been preserved above for reference.
