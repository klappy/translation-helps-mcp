# UW Translation Resources Audit - Summary

**Original Date Claims:** January 2025 (Note: AI-generated date, not real)  
**Actual Date:** Unknown (within 2 weeks of project start)  
**Archived:** Current date

## What This Was

An audit comparing the codebase against unfoldingWord translation resource standards. Found many gaps between the specification and implementation.

## Key Findings Preserved

1. **Terminology Issues:**
   - Code used "Gateway Languages" instead of "Strategic Languages"
   - Missing ULT/GLT and UST/GST terminology
   - No word alignment data support

2. **Missing Features:**
   - ~40% of expected resource endpoints not implemented
   - No Resource Container (RC) manifest parsing
   - Missing core resource types

3. **What Worked:**
   - DCS API client implementation
   - Basic caching functionality

## Why Archived

This audit documented aspirational features that may never have existed. The fake future date (January 2025) and references to missing features suggest this was speculative documentation rather than an actual state assessment.
