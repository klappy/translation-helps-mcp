# API Format Verification Results

Date: 2025-01-03
Status: Mostly working, tests need updating

## Summary

The APIs are returning data that matches our documented expectations from `ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_SPECIFICATION.md`. The issue is that the **tests are expecting an old API format** that no longer exists.

## Working Endpoints

### 1. `get-translation-word` ✅

- **Structure**: Returns `{ word: {...}, metadata: {...} }`
- **Content**: Full article with title, subtitle, and complete markdown content
- **Example**: "love" returns complete definition, translation suggestions, Bible references, examples
- **All fields preserved**: YES

### 2. `fetch-translation-questions` ✅

- **Structure**: Returns `{ translationQuestions: [...], citation: {...}, metadata: {...} }`
- **Content**: Real questions and responses for the reference
- **Example**: John 3:16 returns "How did God show he loved the world?"
- **All TSV fields preserved**: YES (id, reference, question, response, tags)

### 3. `fetch-translation-notes` ✅

- **Structure**: Returns `{ notes: [...], citation: {...}, metadata: {...} }`
- **Content**: Comprehensive notes including intro, chapter intro, and verse-specific notes
- **Example**: John 3:16 returns 9 notes including grammatical, translation, and contextual notes
- **All TSV fields preserved**: YES (Reference, ID, Tags, SupportReference, Quote, Occurrence, Note)

### 4. `browse-translation-academy` ✅

- **Structure**: Returns structured TOC with markdown or JSON format option
- **Content**: Properly formatted table of contents
- **X-ray tracing**: Working

## Issues Found

### 1. `fetch-scripture` ❌

- **Structure**: Correct - returns `{ data: { resources: [], total, reference, ... } }`
- **Problem**: `resources` array is empty (0 translations found)
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - DCS has the data, catalog search works, but aggregation fails

### 2. Test Expectations Mismatch

- Tests expect old format (e.g., `data.text` instead of `data.resources[]`)
- Tests expect different top-level structures than current API provides
- This causes ALL tests to fail even though endpoints work

## Recommendations

1. **Fix `fetch-scripture`**: Debug why ResourceAggregator isn't finding scripture resources
2. **Update Tests**: Rewrite tests to match current API format
3. **Document Format**: Create clear API documentation showing expected request/response formats

## Data Integrity

All endpoints that are returning data are preserving the full source data from DCS:

- TSV fields are complete (no dropped columns)
- Markdown content is intact
- Metadata is comprehensive
- References and links are preserved
