# ðŸ”§ Cloudflare Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Husky Installation Error in CI/CD**

**Problem**: The build was failing with `sh: 1: husky: not found` because husky (git hooks) was trying to install in the Cloudflare build environment.

**Solution**: Modified the `prepare` script in `package.json` to skip husky installation when running in CI environments:

```json
"prepare": "node -e \"if (process.env.CI !== 'true' && process.env.CLOUDFLARE_PAGES !== '1') { require('child_process').execSync('husky', {stdio: 'inherit'}); }\""
```

### 2. **Node.js Module Resolution Error**

**Problem**: Build was failing with errors like "Could not resolve 'crypto'", "Could not resolve 'util'", etc.

**Solution**: Updated `compatibility_date` in `wrangler.toml` from `2025-01-15` to `2024-09-23` to ensure proper Node.js module resolution.

### 3. **Removed All Netlify References**

Since you've moved to Cloudflare exclusively, we cleaned up the codebase:

- âœ… Removed Netlify deployment from GitHub Actions workflow
- âœ… Removed all Netlify-specific npm scripts
- âœ… Removed `@netlify/blobs` dependency
- âœ… Removed `@sveltejs/adapter-netlify` from UI dependencies
- âœ… Deleted old `deploy.sh` script
- âœ… Updated README with Cloudflare-only instructions

## Updated Configuration

### `wrangler.toml`

```toml
name = "translation-helps-mcp"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"  # Critical for Node.js modules
pages_build_output_dir = "ui/.svelte-kit/cloudflare"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
```

### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

- Simplified to only deploy to Cloudflare
- Removed matrix strategy for multiple platforms
- Cleaner, more focused workflow

### Package Scripts

- `npm run build` - Builds for Cloudflare
- `npm run preview` - Preview locally using wrangler
- `npm run deploy` - Manual deployment to Cloudflare Pages

## Deployment Status

Two commits were pushed to fix the issues:

1. **First commit**: Fixed the `compatibility_date` issue
2. **Second commit**: Fixed husky in CI and removed all Netlify references

The GitHub Actions workflow should now:

1. Successfully install dependencies (skipping husky)
2. Build the project with proper Node.js module resolution
3. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

## Next Steps

Monitor the Cloudflare Pages dashboard to ensure:

- âœ… Build completes successfully
- âœ… Deployment is live at `https://translation-helps-mcp.pages.dev`
- âœ… All API endpoints are working correctly

If any issues persist, check:

1. GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Cloudflare Pages build logs in the dashboard
3. Ensure GitHub secrets are properly configured
