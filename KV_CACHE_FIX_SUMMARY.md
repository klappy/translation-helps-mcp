# KV Cache Fix Summary

## The Problem

Cache misses were happening between deployments because:

1. KV namespace binding was configured in `wrangler.toml` ✅
2. BUT most endpoints weren't initializing the KV cache ❌
3. So they were falling back to memory-only cache
4. Memory gets wiped on every deployment → cache misses

## The Root Cause

- Only 3 endpoints (`health`, `test-formatted-scripture`, `test-zip-scripture`) were initializing KV
- All other endpoints using `RouteGenerator` had no KV initialization
- The `createSvelteKitHandler` wasn't passing the `platform` parameter through

## The Fix

Modified `src/functions/platform-adapter.ts`:

```typescript
// Initialize KV cache if available
if (platform?.env?.TRANSLATION_HELPS_CACHE) {
  const { initializeKVCache } = await import("./kv-cache.js");
  initializeKVCache(platform.env.TRANSLATION_HELPS_CACHE);
  logger.info("✅ KV cache initialized via platform adapter");
} else {
  logger.warn("⚠️ No KV namespace binding found - using memory-only cache");
}
```

## What This Means

- ALL endpoints now automatically initialize KV cache
- No more cache misses between deployments
- ZIP files and catalog data persist properly
- Performance should be MUCH better

## How to Verify

After deployment:

1. Check logs for "✅ KV cache initialized via platform adapter"
2. Make an API call
3. Redeploy
4. Make the same API call - should be a cache HIT

## Important Notes

- The KV namespace binding in `wrangler.toml` is correct
- Cloudflare Pages reads it automatically
- No dashboard configuration needed
- Just deploy and it should work!
