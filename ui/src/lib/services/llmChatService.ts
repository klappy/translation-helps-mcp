In John 3:16, we see God\'s love demonstrated through giving His only Son: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."\n\nThis verse shows that God\'s love is:\n- **Sacrificial**: He gave His most precious gift\n- **Universal**: For the entire world\n- **Purposeful**: To bring eternal life\n- **Conditional**: Available to those who believe\n\nIn the original Greek, the word used is "agape" - a selfless, unconditional love that seeks the best for others.',
			'john 3:16':
				'**John 3:16 - The Heart of the Gospel**\n\nThis verse is often called "the gospel in a nutshell" because it summarizes the core message of Christianity:\n\n*"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."*\n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **God\'s Love**: The motivation behind everything\n- **The World**: God\'s love extends to all humanity\n- **His Only Son**: The ultimate sacrifice\n- **Belief**: The condition for receiving eternal life\n- **Eternal Life**: The promise and hope\n\nThis verse appears in Jesus\' conversation with Nicodemus, a religious leader who came to Jesus at night seeking understanding.',
			grace:
				'**Grace - God\'s Unmerited Favor**\n\nGrace is one of the most important concepts in the Bible. It refers to God\'s unmerited favor and kindness toward undeserving sinners.\n\n**Key Aspects of Grace:**\n- **Unearned**: We cannot work for it or deserve it\n- **Free**: Given without cost to us\n- **Sufficient**: Meets all our needs\n- **Transforming**: Changes us from the inside out\n\n**Biblical Examples:**\n- Ephesians 2:8-9: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äîand this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äînot by works, so that no one can boast."\n- Romans 5:8: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."\n\nGrace is the foundation of our relationship with God and the source of all spiritual blessings.'
