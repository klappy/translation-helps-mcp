# üç© NATE'S IMPORTANT REMINDERS

_Because apparently I need to write things down like a normal person_

## TEST COMMANDS - DON'T MESS THIS UP AGAIN

- ‚úÖ USE: `npm run test:smoke` or `vitest run <test-file>`
- ‚ùå DON'T USE: `npm test` (stays in watch mode forever)
- ‚ùå DON'T USE: `vitest <test-file>` (watch mode)

## OTHER THINGS I FORGET

- Always check imports match the actual function signatures
- Read the TypeScript errors instead of guessing
- Coffee gets cold. Accept this fact.

_This file exists because I apparently have the memory of a goldfish when it comes to test commands._
