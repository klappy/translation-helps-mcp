# R2 Bucket Flush Tool Configuration
#
# This is a utility worker for flushing (deleting all objects from) an R2 bucket.
# It runs locally but connects to the REAL production bucket.
#
# Usage:
#   cd scripts
#   npx wrangler dev --config flush-wrangler.toml --remote --port 8788
#   curl http://localhost:8788/flush
#
# To target a different bucket, change bucket_name and preview_bucket_name below.
