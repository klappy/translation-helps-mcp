# Health Endpoint Browser Display Fix

## The Problem

The health endpoint was working correctly and returning detailed health data, but browsers were showing "Failed to load health status" instead of displaying the actual health information.

## Root Cause

The health endpoint was returning HTTP status 503 (Service Unavailable) whenever ANY endpoint reported an error, even if it was just an experimental feature. This caused browsers to treat the entire response as a failed request and show generic error messages instead of parsing the JSON data.

**Problematic Logic:**

```typescript
const httpStatus = overallStatus === "healthy" ? 200 : overallStatus === "warning" ? 200 : 503;
```

## The Solution

Changed the HTTP status logic to only return 503 when **core endpoints** are failing, not experimental ones.

**Fixed Logic:**

```typescript
// Only return 503 if core endpoints are failing, not experimental ones
const coreFailures = coreResults.filter((r) => r.status === "error").length;
const httpStatus = coreFailures > 0 ? 503 : 200;
```

## Results

**Before Fix:**

- Browser: "Failed to load health status" (generic error)
- HTTP Status: 503 Service Unavailable
- Actual Data: ✅ Available but hidden from users

**After Fix:**

- Browser: ✅ Displays full health dashboard with detailed status
- HTTP Status: 200 OK (when only experimental endpoints fail)
- Actual Data: ✅ Properly displayed to users

## Health Status Interpretation

- **HTTP 200 + status "healthy"**: All endpoints working perfectly
- **HTTP 200 + status "warning"**: Minor issues, all core functionality works
- **HTTP 200 + status "error"**: One or more experimental endpoints failing, core functionality intact
- **HTTP 503 + status "error"**: Core endpoints failing, service genuinely unavailable

## Current Status

✅ **Local Development**: Health dashboard displays properly  
✅ **Production**: Health dashboard displays properly  
✅ **API Functionality**: All core endpoints (scripture, notes, questions, etc.) working  
⚠️ **Experimental Feature**: `get-words-for-reference` failing (external dependency issue)

The experimental endpoint failure is a known issue with missing translation word link files and doesn't affect core functionality.
