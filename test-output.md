# John 3:16-18

## ULT

16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his One and Only Son, so that everyone believing in him would not perish but would have eternal life.

17. For God did not send the Son into the world in order to condemn the world, but in order to save the world through him.

18. The one believing in him is not condemned, but the one not believing has already been condemned because he has not believed in the name of the One and Only Son of God.

17. God did not send his Son to earth to condemn the world's people. Instead, he sent his Son so that he would save the world's people.

18. God does not condemn anyone who trusts in his Son. But God has already condemned anyone who does not trust in his Son because that person has refused to trust in God's Unique Son.
