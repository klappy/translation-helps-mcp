# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Lab Environment Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up experimental features in separate room of the house
# Details:
Create clear separation for experimental features:
1. Different room in house (not different house)
2. Shows on MCP Tools page as lower section/tab
3. Separate MCP endpoint for lab features
4. Clear experimental warnings
5. Features that need approval before core promotion:
   - AI quality checking
   - AI summarization
   - Smart endpoint inference
   - Advanced caching
   - Resource recommendations
   - Automated ingestion

# Test Strategy:
Experimental features completely isolated, require explicit approval for promotion

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Experimental Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up directory structure for lab features
### Details:
Create:
- src/experimental/
- src/experimental/README.md (with big warnings)
- Separate config for experimental endpoints
- Clear naming convention (*-experimental.ts)
- Migration path documentation

## 2. Move AI Features to Lab [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Relocate AI features that aren't battle-tested
### Details:
Move:
- ai-content-summarizer.ts
- ai-quality-checker.ts
- Any AI inference features
Add warnings about experimental status
Document approval process for core promotion

## 3. Move Advanced Features [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Relocate poorly executed good ideas
### Details:
Move these 'good ideas poorly executed':
- Resource recommendations
- Advanced caching strategies
- Smart endpoint inference
- Automated content ingestion
- Language coverage (needs better implementation)

## 4. Create Lab MCP Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Separate MCP server endpoint for experimental
### Details:
Create:
- /api/mcp-experimental
- Clear warnings in tool descriptions
- Separate documentation
- Note that LLMs might try to use these
- Approval process for promotion

## 5. Document Promotion Criteria [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Define how features graduate to core
### Details:
Document requirements:
- Your explicit approval required
- Partner approval required
- Performance benchmarks met
- Real-world testing completed
- Documentation complete
- Tests with real data
