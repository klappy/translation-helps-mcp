# Task ID: 3
# Title: Code Audit & Cleanup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove deprecated code, fix endpoints returning empty/bogus data, eliminate duplicate functionality
# Details:
1. Remove code that returns empty/bogus data
2. Fix experimental endpoints claiming to work but don't
3. Remove duplicate implementations
4. PRESERVE the working cascading cache system (DCS API → Files → Response)
5. KEEP the xray transparency features that work
6. Move only BROKEN experimental features to lab
7. Clean up imports and dependencies
8. Fix any code that hangs waiting for input
9. Remove interactive commands from build/test scripts

# Test Strategy:
Run full test suite with REAL data validation, verify no hanging processes, check core endpoints return accurate data, ensure cache performance remains <500ms

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix Empty/Bogus Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and fix endpoints returning empty or incorrect data
### Details:
Audit all endpoints:
- Test each with real parameters
- Document which return empty/bogus data
- Fix or remove broken endpoints
- Ensure experimental endpoints don't claim to fetch resources they can't
Focus on core resource fetching accuracy

## 2. Preserve Working Cache System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Keep the cascading cache that took 2 days to optimize
### Details:
PRESERVE these working features:
- Cascading cache (DCS API → Files → Response)
- Cache performance optimizations
- Xray transparency for debugging
- Performance monitoring that works

These are CORE features, not experimental!

## 3. Move Only Broken Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Relocate only non-working experimental features
### Details:
Move to experimental ONLY:
- AI features that don't work reliably
- Broken aggregation endpoints
- Non-functional recommendations
- Features that return empty data

KEEP in core:
- Working cache system
- Performance monitoring
- Xray transparency

## 4. Clean Up Service Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Remove unused services but keep working cache/performance
### Details:
Keep:
- DCSApiClient (core)
- Scripture service
- Translation helps services
- CASCADING CACHE SYSTEM
- Performance monitoring
- Xray transparency

Remove only:
- Broken aggregators
- Non-working recommenders

## 5. Update Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.4
### Description: Fix tests to validate REAL data, not just 200 OK
### Details:
Update all tests to:
- Check actual scripture text returned
- Validate tN content matches reference
- Verify tW definitions are complete
- Ensure tWL properly links verses to words
- Test with real verse ranges, pericopes, chapters
- Remove tests that just check status codes
- ADD tests for cache performance
