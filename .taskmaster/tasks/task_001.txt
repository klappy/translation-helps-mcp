   - Developer Portal content (it's 10% complete)
   - Placeholder guides
5. Fix all time-travel dates (no more 2023 references)
6. Document actual resource data shapes for each endpoint

# Test Strategy:
Manual review of all documentation files, ensure no broken links, verify accuracy against codebase, check all dates are current

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Archive Structure [done]

Create README.md in archive explaining the archival structure
Document why each item was archived

## 2. Archive Outdated Documentation [done]
