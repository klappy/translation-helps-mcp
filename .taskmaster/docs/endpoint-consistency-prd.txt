# Endpoint Consistency & Metadata Standardization PRD

## Project Overview
Transform the translation-helps-mcp system from a collection of inconsistent endpoints into a unified, maintainable architecture that follows KISS and DRY principles. The fetch-scripture endpoint serves as the golden standard - all other endpoints must match its behavior, caching, metadata handling, and error management while preserving their unique business logic.

## Problem Statement
Currently, 7 endpoints use the modern configuration-based RouteGenerator system while 11 endpoints still use the old RequestHandler pattern. This creates:
- Inconsistent metadata structures across endpoints
- X-ray traces contaminating response bodies instead of staying in headers
- Manual maintenance burden requiring hours of work to keep endpoints synchronized
- Risk of regression when one endpoint is updated but others aren't
- Violation of DRY principles with duplicated error handling and caching logic

## Success Criteria
1. All 18 endpoints use identical configuration patterns and RouteGenerator
2. X-ray traces only appear in headers, never in response bodies
3. Business metadata (source counts, coverage metrics) is standardized across endpoints
4. Zero regression in fetch-scripture endpoint functionality
5. Automated endpoint generation prevents future inconsistencies
6. All original PRD tasks (AI chat interface, showcase experience) are completed

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding (Week 1)
- Remove xrayTrace contamination from all response bodies
- Add lint rules to prevent future diagnostic data in responses
- Preserve all existing business metadata functionality
- Ensure fetch-scripture endpoint remains unchanged

### Phase 2: Standardize Architecture (Week 2-3)
- Migrate all 11 old endpoints to RouteGenerator system
- Standardize business metadata interface across all endpoints
- Create automated endpoint generation script
- Implement comprehensive testing to prevent regression

### Phase 3: Complete Original Vision (Week 4-5)
- Implement AI Assistant Chat Interface (Task 9 from original PRD)
- Create "Taste and See" showcase experience
- Final testing and deployment
- Documentation and user guides

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental changes with production-ready commits after each phase
- Comprehensive testing after each endpoint migration
- Rollback strategy for each phase
- Preserve fetch-scripture endpoint as immutable reference
- Automated validation to prevent future inconsistencies

## Deliverables
1. 18 consistently architected endpoints
2. Automated endpoint generation system
3. Standardized business metadata interface
4. AI chat interface for showcase
5. Complete documentation and testing suite
6. Zero regression in existing functionality

## Success Metrics
- All endpoints pass identical validation tests
- X-ray traces only in headers, never in response bodies
- Business metadata follows consistent patterns
- Automated generation prevents future inconsistencies
- Original PRD tasks completed
- Zero production incidents during migration
