## Translation Helps MCP Architecture

This project follows a **three-tier architecture** for organizing functionality:

### üîß **CORE - DCS Proxies**

_Clean, formatted versions of Door43 Content Service data_

**Location:** `/api/` endpoints in production  
**Purpose:** Direct proxies to DCS with minimal processing - JSON formatting, caching, error handling

**Endpoints:**

- `fetch-scripture` - Scripture text from ULT, UST, T4T, UEB translations
- `fetch-translation-notes` - Verse-by-verse translation notes
- `fetch-translation-questions` - Comprehension questions for passages
- `fetch-translation-academy` - Translation Academy articles
- `get-translation-word` - Individual translation word definitions
- `fetch-translation-word-links` - Links between verses and translation words
- `get-languages` - Available languages list
- `get-available-books` - Available books per language/organization
- `list-available-resources` - Resource catalog from DCS

**Characteristics:**

- Response time: <100ms (with caching)
- Data format: JSON (default) with optional TSV for exact DCS content
- No cross-resource bridging - one DCS resource per call
- Minimal business logic - just formatting and performance optimization

### üöÄ **EXTENDED - Value-Added Bridging**

_Production-ready features that combine multiple DCS resources intelligently_

**Location:** `/api/` endpoints in production  
**Purpose:** Save developers from making multiple chained calls by combining DCS data with smart logic

**Endpoints:**

- `resource-recommendations` - AI-powered recommendations for which resources to use for a passage
- `fetch-resources` - Aggregates multiple translation resources (notes, questions, etc.) in one call
- `resource-catalog` - Enhanced catalog with metadata and usage statistics

**Characteristics:**

- Response time: <500ms
- Combines 2-10 DCS API calls into single response
- Adds business logic and intelligence
- Production-ready with comprehensive testing
- Includes performance monitoring and caching

### üß™ **EXPERIMENTAL - LLM-Powered Crazy Ideas**

_Advanced features using AI/LLM for heavy lifting_

**Location:** `src/experimental/` directory  
**Purpose:** Experimental features that use LLMs to do complex reasoning and provide intelligent responses

**Features:**

#### ü§ñ AI-Powered Content Processing

- `ai-content-summarizer.ts` - LLM-powered content summarization (mock implementation)
- `ai-quality-checker.ts` - AI quality assessment for translations (mock implementation)

#### üí¨ LLM Chat Interfaces

- `chat` - AI Bible assistant with context awareness
- `chat-reasoning` - Chat with visible reasoning process
- `chat-stream` - Streaming chat responses
- `chat-dynamic` - Dynamic chat with adaptive responses (moved to `api-routes/`)

#### üî¨ Advanced MCP Features

- `resource-aggregator-unused.ts` - Duplicate from core (moved here, unused)
- `resource-recommendations.ts` - Alternative recommendations engine
- `resource-recommender.ts` - Alternative recommender (experimental version)

#### üóÑÔ∏è Deprecated Features

- `cache-warmer.ts` - Deprecated cache warming system
- `automated-content-ingestion.ts` - Automated content discovery (30% complete)

**Characteristics:**

- May use external LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- Response times variable (500ms - 30s depending on LLM)
- Heavy computational requirements
- Mock implementations for cost control
- Not guaranteed to work reliably

---

## Promotion Path Between Tiers

### Experimental ‚Üí Extended

1. Replace mock LLM calls with efficient algorithms
2. Achieve <500ms response times consistently
3. Add comprehensive testing and error handling
4. Prove production stability over 30+ days

### Extended ‚Üí Core

Extended features generally stay extended unless they become simple DCS proxies.

### Experimental ‚Üí Core (Rare)

Only if the feature becomes a simple DCS proxy with no cross-resource logic.

## Promotion Criteria

For any feature to move up a tier, it must:

1. **Get explicit approval** from project maintainers
2. **Get partner approval** from stakeholders
3. **Meet performance benchmarks**:
   - Response time < 500ms for 95th percentile
   - Cache hit ratio > 80%
   - Error rate < 0.1%
4. **Pass real-world testing**:
   - Used in production for 30+ days
   - Processed 10,000+ requests
   - No critical bugs reported
5. **Have complete documentation**:
   - API documentation
   - Integration guide
   - Migration guide from experimental
6. **Have comprehensive tests**:
   - Unit tests with >90% coverage
   - Integration tests with real data
   - Load tests proving scalability

### Specific Promotion Requirements by Feature

#### AI Features (High Scrutiny Required)

- **ai-content-summarizer.ts**: Replace mock responses with real LLM integration, achieve consistent <500ms response times, demonstrate cost-effectiveness
- **ai-quality-checker.ts**: Replace mock responses with real LLM integration, validate accuracy against human expert reviews, prove reliability

#### Advanced Features (Implementation Quality Focus)

- **language-coverage-experimental.ts**: Remove hard-coded estimates, implement proper resource counting, test across multiple references, improve detection accuracy
- **resource-recommendations.ts**: Validate recommendation quality against user feedback, optimize for performance
- **automated-content-ingestion.ts**: Complete webhook implementation, add error handling, implement rate limiting

#### MCP Experimental Tools

- **mcp-experimental endpoint**: Each tool must individually meet all promotion criteria above before being moved to production MCP endpoint
- All experimental tools must demonstrate real value over mock responses
- Performance testing required under realistic load conditions

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: No experimental feature should be promoted without explicit written approval from both project maintainers AND implementation partners. This ensures quality control and prevents premature deployment of unstable features.

## Using Experimental Features

### In Development

```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
import { ExperimentalFeature } from "../experimental/feature-experimental";

// Must explicitly acknowledge experimental status
const feature = new ExperimentalFeature({
  acknowledgeExperimental: true,
});
```

### API Endpoints

Experimental features are accessible via:

- Debug/Test endpoints: Moved to experimental but still accessible for development
- Experimental MCP: `/api/mcp-experimental` (moved to experimental directory)

## Migration Path

When a feature is approved for core:

1. Remove `-experimental` suffix from filename
2. Move to appropriate core directory
3. Update all imports
4. Remove experimental warnings
5. Add to core endpoint configuration
6. Update documentation
7. Announce in changelog
