# üß™ EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES LAB

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL CODE AHEAD ‚ö†Ô∏è

This directory contains experimental features that are:

- **NOT production-ready**
- **NOT guaranteed to work reliably**
- **NOT covered by stability guarantees**
- **SUBJECT TO CHANGE without notice**

## What's in the Lab?

### AI-Powered Features

- **ai-content-summarizer.ts** - AI-powered content summarization (currently using mock responses)
- **ai-quality-checker.ts** - AI quality assessment (currently using mock responses)

### Advanced Features (Good Ideas, Poor Execution)

- **resource-aggregator.ts** - Duplicate resource aggregation implementation
- **cache-warmer.ts** - Deprecated cache warming system
- **automated-content-ingestion.ts** - Automated content discovery and ingestion

## Promotion Criteria

For a feature to move from experimental to core, it must:

1. **Get explicit approval** from project maintainers
2. **Get partner approval** from stakeholders
3. **Meet performance benchmarks**:
   - Response time < 500ms for 95th percentile
   - Cache hit ratio > 80%
   - Error rate < 0.1%
4. **Pass real-world testing**:
   - Used in production for 30+ days
   - Processed 10,000+ requests
   - No critical bugs reported
5. **Have complete documentation**:
   - API documentation
   - Integration guide
   - Migration guide from experimental
6. **Have comprehensive tests**:
   - Unit tests with >90% coverage
   - Integration tests with real data
   - Load tests proving scalability

## Using Experimental Features

### In Development

```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
import { ExperimentalFeature } from "../experimental/feature-experimental";

// Must explicitly acknowledge experimental status
const feature = new ExperimentalFeature({
  acknowledgeExperimental: true,
});
```

### MCP Endpoint

Experimental features are exposed via a separate MCP endpoint:

- Production: `/api/mcp`
- Experimental: `/api/mcp-experimental`

## Migration Path

When a feature is approved for core:

1. Remove `-experimental` suffix from filename
2. Move to appropriate core directory
3. Update all imports
4. Remove experimental warnings
5. Add to core endpoint configuration
6. Update documentation
7. Announce in changelog

## Current Status

| Feature               | Status          | Progress  | Notes                            |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| AI Content Summarizer | üî¨ Experimental | Mock only | Needs real AI integration        |
| AI Quality Checker    | üî¨ Experimental | Mock only | Needs real AI integration        |
| Resource Aggregator   | ‚ùå Deprecated   | N/A       | Duplicate of core implementation |
| Cache Warmer          | ‚ùå Deprecated   | N/A       | Feature removed from roadmap     |
| Automated Ingestion   | üî¨ Experimental | 30%       | Needs webhook implementation     |
