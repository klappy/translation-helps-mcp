# Changelog

All notable changes to the Translation Helps API will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-12-20

### Added

- **Multi-Translation Scripture Support**: API now returns ALL available Bible translations (ULT, UST, T4T, UEB, etc.) in a new `scriptures` array
- **Dynamic Bible Resource Discovery**: Automatically finds all available Bible translations using the DCS catalog API
- **Clean Text Extraction**: Implemented proper USFM text extraction that removes all markup and alignment data

### Changed

- Scripture fetching now uses the **Ingredients Array Pattern** for reliable resource resolution
