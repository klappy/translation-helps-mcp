- **LLM-First Response Generation**: AI now processes raw context data directly, leveraging natural language understanding
- **Simplified BrowserLLM Service**: Removed complex regex parsing in favor of intelligent LLM processing
- **Enhanced Context Prompting**: Improved prompt engineering for better AI responses
- **Robust Development Setup**: Fixed TypeScript configuration and build process issues

#### 🔧 Changed

- **AI Response Architecture**: Replaced brittle regex parsing with LLM-native content processing
- **BrowserLLM Service**: Simplified from complex parsing methods to direct LLM interaction
- **Development Workflow**: Improved build process and cache management
- **Code Organization**: Removed unnecessary parsing utilities in favor of LLM intelligence

#### 🐛 Fixed

- **Development Setup Fragility**: Resolved TypeScript configuration issues after cache clearing
- **Browser Caching Issues**: Fixed persistent old code loading due to aggressive caching
- **Build Process**: Proper SvelteKit build configuration and TypeScript compilation
- **AI Response Formatting**: Translation word data now displays properly without manual parsing

#### 📚 Documentation

- **Updated Architecture**: Documentation reflects new LLM-first approach
- **Development Setup**: Improved instructions for local development
- **AI Response System**: Clear explanation of new simplified architecture

#### 🏗️ Technical Improvements

- **Removed Brittle Code**: Eliminated complex regex patterns and manual parsing
- **Enhanced LLM Integration**: Better prompt engineering for context-aware responses
- **Improved Build Process**: Fixed TypeScript configuration and SvelteKit build issues
- **Cache Management**: Proper development cache clearing and build process

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

This release introduces significant changes to the Translation Words API that are not backwards compatible.

#### Breaking API Changes

- **Translation Words Response Structure**: The `fetch-translation-words` endpoint now returns additional fields by default:
  - `title`: Article title (defaults to `true`)
  - `subtitle`: Article subtitle (defaults to `
