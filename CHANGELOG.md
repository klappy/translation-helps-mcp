## [6.0.0](https://github.com/klappy/translation-helps-mcp/compare/v5.7.0...v6.0.0) (2025-01-10)

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES

This major release completes the V2 API migration by replacing all V1 endpoints with their V2 implementations. While endpoint paths remain the same, response formats and behavior have changed significantly.

### What's Changed

#### Complete V2 Replacement

- **Direct Migration** - V2 endpoints moved to root `/api/` path, replacing V1
- **No Deprecation Period** - Clean cut-over with no parallel V1/V2 operation
- **Self-Discoverable** - API is now fully self-documenting via `/api/mcp-config`

#### Enhanced Features

- **X-Ray Tracing** - Detailed performance visibility via response headers
  - `X-Cache-Status`: Shows hit/miss/partial for cache performance
  - `X-XRay-Trace`: Base64 encoded full trace data
  - `X-Trace-Id`, `X-Trace-Service`, `X-Trace-API-Calls`, etc.
- **Real Data Only** - All mock data removed, 100% real Bible translation data
- **Cleaner Responses** - Simplified JSON structure, removed redundancy
- **Better Errors** - Detailed error responses with context and traces

#### Response Format Changes

- Scripture responses no longer have redundant `citation` object
- Removed duplicate fields between top-level and metadata
- Fixed `foundResources` to show actual resources instead of nulls
- Simplified scripture items to just `text` and `translation`

### Migration Guide

Since the API is self-discoverable, migration is straightforward:

1. Fetch `/api/mcp-config` to discover all endpoints
2. Update to use new response formats (see examples in API docs)
3. Leverage X-ray tracing headers for debugging
4. Remove any V1-specific workarounds

### Full Endpoint List

See `/api/mcp-config` for the complete, up-to-date endpoint registry with parameters and examples.
